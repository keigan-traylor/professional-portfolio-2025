# Professional Portfolio — Machine Learning, AWS Automation, PowerShell & Advanced Python

This repository contains four professional projects designed to showcase advanced technical skills attractive to employers in ML, cloud automation, cybersecurity automation, and Python engineering.

Projects:
1. `ml-model-training/` — advanced end-to-end ML training pipeline (data, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, experiment tracking).
2. `aws-lambda-provisioning/` — automated AWS account provisioning patterns using `boto3` and Lambda deployment workflow (safe, documented; **do not run without AWS credentials and understanding**).
3. `advanced-powershell-automation/` — production-grade PowerShell automation focused on secure automation patterns, remoting, logging, modules, and defensive checks.
4. `advanced-python-tooling/` — advanced Python project demonstrating async architecture, decorators, context managers, type hints, plugin system, and tests.

Each project includes a `README.md` that explains the objective, concepts demonstrated, how to run (or safely simulate), and employer talking points. The projects use sample or synthetic data so they can be explored locally. Replace simulated parts with real infrastructure access only when authorized.
