# Professional Portfolio — Machine Learning, AWS Automation, PowerShell & Python

This repository contains four professional exhibition projects designed to showcase technical skills in ML, cloud automation, cybersecurity automation, and Python engineering.

Projects:
1. `ml-model-training/` — example end-to-end ML training pipeline (data, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, experiment tracking).
2. `aws-lambda-provisioning/` — automated AWS account provisioning patterns using `boto3` and Lambda deployment workflow (**do not run without AWS credentials and understanding**).
3. `advanced-powershell-automation/` — production like PowerShell automation focused on secure automation patterns, remoting, logging, modules, and defensive checks.
4. `advanced-python-tooling/` — advanced Python project demonstrating async architecture, decorators, context managers, type hints, plugin system, and tests.

Each project includes a `README.md` that explains the objective, concepts demonstrated and how to run. The projects use sample data so they can be run locally.
